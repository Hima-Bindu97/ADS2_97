	People today spend too much time on personal enjoyment?Doing things they like to do-rather than doing things they should do.



	I agree with the above statement while some disagree.According to me,I think that people should find free time to enjoy their lives. In Fact,if they have extra time they use it for their personal lives.There are some reasons why I agree with that statement.

	First,these days people are very busy at their jobs.They spend more than half a day at work.Most of their employment will be hardful and stressful.If they have one day off per week,they would use that day to relax or to finish their responsibilities.For example,my father works every day from morning to evening.He could not find free time to meet his friends.So,he will spend too much time with his friends at his free time.
 
	Second,human life is so expensive.People need money to enjoy their lives.For this,they have to work long hours and raise their salaries.Therefore,one cannot find free time or enough money for their personal enjoyment. In fact,people who have time and need some entertainment after hard work chooses personal enjoyment.

	Finally,those busy people who usually work most of their time,needs some enjoyment.They need free time for their social lives to keep in touch with their relatives and friends.
	In conclusion,I strongly agree with this statement.Also,all kids need that free time for enjoyment.
